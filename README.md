man this class is going to kill me .(._. ).

NOTE FROM PROFESSOR:
Neither doubly linked list and singly linked list is better than one another

```cpp
// main.cpp
std::string learning = "Time to relearn cpp in 6 month and apply it to data structures";
std::int studying;

std::cout << "how many hours am i going to study?";
std::cin >> studying;

if (studying == 0){
  std::cout << "yeah you're cooked";
} else {
  std::cout << "good luck in the class and try and not blow your brains out";
}
```
